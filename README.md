# Instructions
Use arrow keys to move.
# Building
The project can be opened in Godot and built, though the leaderboard will not work out of the box.  To make a build from source with a leaderboard, you will need to edit the HTTPRequest in penguin.gd and board.gd to have your public and private keys from dreamlo.com.  If you want to use the official leaderboard, you will have to download an official build.
